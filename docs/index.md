# Overview

We structure information around key data and methods.

## Data

Includes large domains of data and such as [[population-data]], climate, and land use, while each is subdivided into specific datasets and providers, such [[global-human-settlement]] for [[population-data]]. 


## Methods

Methods often use different kinds of data to produce new sort of statistics.
For example, 

-   [[zonal-statistics]] use [[vector-data]] to aggregate [[population-data]].
